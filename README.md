Abstract:
Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) enhance real-time data transmission and environmental awareness, becoming a cornerstone for future 6G systems. To meet the growing demands for massive connectivity and ubiquitous coverage, Distributed Integrated Sensing and Communications (DISAC) employs a distributed architecture and a goal-oriented framework. DISAC systems enable large-scale, energy-efficient tracking of connected users and passive objects, facilitating both communications and sensing services. These advancements open new applications in domains such as autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and industrial automation, where situational awareness and precision are critical.

This tutorial provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in DISAC, addressing key technical challenges and practical solutions, including cooperative localization, resource optimization, and the integration of AI-driven semantic communications with sensing. The tutorial is organized into three sections:
(i) Fundamentals of DISAC operations and systems
(ii) Distributed communication-aided sensing
(iii) Distributed sensing-aided communication

Through in-depth discussions on DISAC architectures, high-resolution distributed processing, and AI-based semantic techniques, this tutorial provides essential background for newcomers and offers advanced insights for experienced researchers seeking to deepen their expertise in emerging 6G technologies.
